## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project that aims to classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam (ham). The project utilizes various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a supervised learning algorithm to build a text classification model.

## Usage

The project notebooks in the notebooks/ directory are numbered in the recommended execution order. Each notebook contains detailed explanations and code to follow along<br><br>
Start by opening the spam-classifier.ipynb notebook to understand the data preprocessing steps.
Proceed to the subsequent notebooks for feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
The final file, app.py, provides an example of how to deploy the trained model as a web service.
